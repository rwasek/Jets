## Jets Project - Week 3 Skill Distillery

### Overview

A dynamic Object-Oriented program that was created to learn more about Abstraction and Inheritance of classes. The program launches with a Menu that gives the user multiple options on how to engage with Jets that were read in from a text file.  The user has different options on viewing information about the jets, and is even able to create their own, or remove one from the fleet. 

### Technologies Used

- Eclipse

- Java

- Terminal Commands

- GitHub/Git

- Google


### Lessons Learned

- Implementing interfaces is a useful way to give certain classes specific and unique attributes even if they hail from the same Parent class.  Use of "instanceof" was important to learn and remember to make the interfaces methods actually execute.

- I got more practice with the toString( ) method, and manipulating what is being displayed on the screen.  Utilized java functions for decimal rounding, as well as adding commas to long numbers.

- Had a goal of only having two lines of code in the main of the JetsApplication class and was able to do so with use of numerous methods.

- Using a reader to import data from a text file, getting practice with ArrayLists by storing the read lines into one, and then manipulating those lines of Strings into usable chunks of data with Wrapper classes by breaking them up with the .split("") method -- storing each part of data in an array to be referenced, was the hardest part of this project.
